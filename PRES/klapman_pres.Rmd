## 2018 U.S. Midterms

- Took place on Nov. 4th 2018

- Data: 309 "generic ballot" polls from Real Clear Politics

![Current results](us_map.PNG){#id .class width=250}


## Initial Bootstrapping

- Naive estimate: equal weighting of polls


```{r}
prop_diff_est <- mean(rcp_midterms$prop_diff)
ci_noweight <- with(rcp_midterms, boot_ci_propdiff(prop_diff))
```

- Estimated difference in proportions: Dem +`r round(prop_diff_est, 4)*100`%

  95% Bootstrapped CI: (`r round(ci_noweight[1],4)*100`%, `r round(ci_noweight[2],4)*100`%)

- Compare with the *current* results from The New York Times: Dem +`r 51.9-46.3`%

## Additional Techniques

- Change probability of being selected in the bootstrap

    - Higher weight for recent polls and *likely* *voters*
    
- Use "relative support" (i.e. $\frac{Dem}{Dem + Rep}$)

```{r}
rcp_lv <- filter(rcp_midterms, SampType == "LV")
ci_lv <- with(rcp_lv, boot_ci_propdiff(prop_diff))
ci_weight <- with(rcp_midterms, boot_ci_propdiff(prop_diff, prob = prob))
ci_noweight <- with(rcp_midterms, boot_ci_propdiff(prop_diff))
ci_relative <- with(rcp_midterms, boot_ci_propdiff(rel_diff))

w_est <- with(rcp_midterms, weighted.mean(prop_diff, w = prob)) # weighted estimate of proportion.
rel_est <- with(rcp_midterms, mean(rel_diff))
lv_est <- with(rcp_lv, mean(prop_diff))

confints <- as.tibble(rbind(ci_noweight, ci_weight, ci_relative, ci_lv)) %>% 
  add_column(BootType = c("No Weights", "Weights", "Relative", "LikelyVoters")) %>%
  add_column(Est = c(prop_diff_est, w_est, rel_est, lv_est))


ggplot(data = confints) +

  geom_pointrange(aes(x = BootType, y = Est, ymin = `2.5%`, ymax = `97.5%`)) +
  annotate("segment", x = "Relative", y = .06, xend = "Relative", yend = .0565, 
           arrow = arrow(), size=.4, alpha=.5, color = "blue") + 
  annotate("text", x = "Relative", y = 0.065, label = "True Difference", color = "blue", alpha = .5)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(.05, .056, .06, .07, .08, .09)) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(y = "Estimated Prop. Diff. (Dem - Rep)", title = "Comparing estimations of 2018 U.S. Midterms")
